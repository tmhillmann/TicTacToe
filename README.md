TicTacToe
=========

Tic-Tac-Toe was a demonstration in playing games on different topological surfaces. It also served as a basic tutorial in creating a GUI on a figure in Matlab with various types of callbacks. The AI is entirely random, but while Tic-Tac-Toe is an easy game to write AI for, the purpose of my program was more designed around identifying how moves interact when the board is connected in some fashion.
